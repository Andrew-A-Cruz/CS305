Software Security Class

Artemis Financial is a company that deals with the finances of their customers. They are trying to modernize their business with a secure way to access data from the web. It was critiacl that the data being transmitted through the web was secure and encrypted. It was also critical that the encryption made sense and was secure enough, as well as efficient enough. Secure coding is a critical part of writing software because people rely on software all the time. Code that isn't secure can put people's lives and/or carreers in jeopardy. Coding with a secure mindset is something all developers should strive to do. Working through a vulerability report was extremely intersting and I didn't realize how powerful Maven was and how much information was out there to help developers stay secure. I did find it quite time consuming to go through every vulerability to identify if there was a patch. This class taught me how to use encryption in java, so to increase security I used SHA-256 encryption. I believed this to be a good balance between secure and efficient. I struggled immensely to get my code to run because I was unable to get my certificate to cooperate, however my code was sound and I don't believe I introduced anymore vulnerabilities. Skills that I took away from this class would be a much stronger understanding of Maven as well as a strong grasp on encryption.
